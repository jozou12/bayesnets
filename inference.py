    You *must* name all variables using the constants in this function.

    In this method, you should:
    - populate `variables` with the Bayes Net nodes
    - populate `edges` with every edge in the Bayes Net. we will represent each
      edge as a tuple `(from, to)`.
    - set each `variableDomainsDict[var] = values`, where `values` is a list
      of the possible assignments to `var`.
        - each agent position is a tuple (x, y) where x and y are 0-indexed
        - each observed distance is a noisy Manhattan distance:
          it's non-negative and |obs - true| <= MAX_NOISE

        This function should perform a probabilistic inference query that
        returns the factor:

        P(queryVariables | evidenceDict)

        It should perform inference by interleaving joining on a variable
        and eliminating that variable, in the order of variables according
        to eliminationOrder.  See inferenceByEnumeration for an example on
        how to use these functions.

        You need to use joinFactorsByVariable to join all of the factors 
        that contain a variable so the operation tracking records the correct interleaving of
        joins and eliminates.

        If a factor that you are about to eliminate a variable from has 
        only one unconditioned variable, you should not eliminate it 
        and instead just discard the factor.  This is since the 
        result of the eliminate would be 1 (you marginalize 
        all of the unconditioned variables), but it is not a 
        valid factor.  So this simplifies using the result of eliminate.

        The sum of the probabilities should sum to one (so that it is a true 
        conditional probability, conditioned on the evidence).

        bayesNet:         The Bayes Net on which we are making a query.
        queryVariables:   A list of the variables which are unconditioned
                          in the inference query.
        evidenceDict:     An assignment dict {variable : value} for the
                          variables which are presented as evidence
                          (conditioned) in the inference query. 
        eliminationOrder: The order to eliminate the variables in.

        Hint: BayesNet.getAllCPTsWithEvidence will return all the Conditional 
        Probability Tables even if an empty dict (or None) is passed in for 
        evidenceDict. In this case it will not specialize any variable domains 
        in the CPTs.
